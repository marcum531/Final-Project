# Final-Project

Our group included Hannah Lee, Nicole Marcum, Nakouma Sako, and Katie Harris.

For our project proposal, we chose to examine unemployment trends in the United States as a whole, while drilling down into Ohio-specific data. Additionally, we wanted to visualize what employment data might've looked like in the year 2020 had the Covid-19 Pandemic never occurred. In doing this, we chose to focus on three counties in Ohio: Butler, Franklin, and Cuyahoga. These are located in Southern, Central, and Northern Ohio respectively. Butler County is a more rural setting, Franklin county is relatively more urban, and Cuyahoga County is the most urban setting.

In looking at historical employment data on a national basis, we chose to focus on years 2015-2019. Nicole created Tableau visualizations for this data, showing both unemployment rates and numbers of the population that were employed during this time. The visualizations are broken down by state. Nicole also used Plotly to create some charts reflecting the unemployment trends within the 3 chosen counties of Ohio.

Nakouma utilized Scikit and Machine Learning to create visualizations of what emplyoment trends may have looked like in these 3 Ohio counties in 2020 (based on previous trends ) if the pandemic had not occurred this year.

Katie tackled the web design portion of the project, using HTML for most of the design and including Javascript to embed the Tableau data visualizations. We wanted to focus on side-by-side comparisons of the charts so that differences in historical data and predicted data would be clear to the viewer.
